# myo-hand-prosthesis
Arduino code to provide robust, fine motor control of fingers on a rudimentary prosthetic hand. This is accomplished through readings of electromyographic (EMG) signals with a myoelectric sensor, and appropriate scaling of a stepper motor's steps based on the magnitude of each EMG peak about an expected threshold for movement.
